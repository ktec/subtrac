= Welcome to the <%= server_name %> for <%= project.display_name %> =

This is the home of development for <%= client.display_name %>. This page is editable by design. That means YOU. If something is missing, fix it. This is what you make of it so get involved.

== Starting Points ==

 * [http://<%= server_hostname %><%= svn_url %>/<%= client.path %> Browse all <%= client.display_name %> SVN Repositories]
 * [http://<%= server_hostname %><%= svn_url %>/<%= client.path %>/<%= project.path %> Browse the <%= project.display_name %> repository]

=== How to check this project out ===

Make sure you have subversion client installed, then you can check the project out using:

{{{
svn checkout http://<%= server_hostname %><%= svn_url %>/<%= client.path %>/<%= project.path %>/trunk <%= project.path %>
}}}

=== How to import existing files into this repository ===

The following example will import all files in the current directory into the repository.

{{{
svn import . http://<%= server_hostname %><%= svn_url %>/<%= client.path %>/<%= project.path %>/trunk -m "initial import"
}}}

=== Using SVN ===

 * [http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ For Windows use Tortoise SVN]
 * [http://scplugin.tigris.org/ For OS X use SCPlugin]
 * [http://theappleblog.com/2009/02/23/12-subversion-apps-for-os-x/ There's loads more if you don't like these]


=== Code Commit Hooks ===

It searches commit messages for text in the form of:
{{{
  command #1
  command #1, #2
  command #1 & #2
  command #1 and #2
}}}
Instead of the short-hand syntax "#1", "ticket:1" can be used as well, e.g.:
{{{
  command ticket:1
  command ticket:1, ticket:2
  command ticket:1 & ticket:2
  command ticket:1 and ticket:2
}}}
In addition, the ':' character can be omitted and issue or bug can be used
instead of ticket.

You can have more then one command in a message. The following commands
are supported. There is more then one spelling for each command, to make
this as user-friendly as possible.

  close, closed, closes, fix, fixed, fixes
    The specified issue numbers are closed with the contents of this
    commit message being added to it.
  references, refs, addresses, re, see
    The specified issue numbers are left in their current status, but
    the contents of this commit message are added to their notes.

A fairly complicated example of what you can do is with a commit message
of:
{{{
   Changed blah and foo to do this or that. Fixes #10 and #12, and refs #12.
}}}

This will close #10 and #12, and add a note to #12.

The time spent is specified in parenthesis. :

{{{
ex. re #853 (1) adds one hour to the ticket 853
}}}

{{{
svn commit -m 'closes #1 (1), refs #2 (.5)  Added time tracking'
}}}

This closes ticket #1, increases the time spent by 1 hour. It adds an entry to the Changelog of ticket #2, increases the time spent by .5 hours.
